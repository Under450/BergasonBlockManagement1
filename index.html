Garside v RFYC
×
Year: 2011 | Court: Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber)

Key Findings:
The case concerned whether the cost of major works was "reasonably incurred" under s.19 Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.
The Tribunal held that "reasonableness" is not just about the cost of the works themselves, but also the financial impact on leaseholders.
Landlords may be required to "phase" works over several years to reduce the immediate financial burden.
However, essential repairs (e.g., leaking roofs) may still need immediate action regardless of cost.
Established that leaseholder affordability is a relevant factor in decision-making.
Waaler v LB Hounslow
×
Year: 2017 | Court: Court of Appeal

Key Findings:
Concerned the replacement of windows where the old windows were not in total disrepair but replacement was an improvement.
Distinguished between 'repairs' (where landlord has a duty) and 'improvements' (discretionary).
If carrying out discretionary improvements, the landlord must take particular account of the leaseholders' financial views and means.
Failure to consider financial hardship rendered the decision to improve irrational in public law terms.
Emphasised the need for real consultation, not just a tick-box exercise.
Holland v Oxford CC
×
Year: 2002 | Court: High Court

Key Findings:
Focused on the transparency of service charge accounts.
Ruled that leaseholders are entitled to see the underlying receipts, invoices, and vouchers, not just a spreadsheet summary.
Facilities for inspection must be provided by the landlord.
Reinforced the rights under Section 22 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.
Prevents landlords from hiding costs behind vague accounting entries.
Francis v Phillips
×
Year: 2014 | Court: Court of Appeal

Key Findings:
Redefined "qualifying works" for Section 20 consultation.
Overturned previous High Court ruling that looked at 'sets' of works.
Established that works should be looked at broadly: if a project costs more than £250 per leaseholder in total, consultation is required.
Prevents landlords from artificially splitting contracts to avoid consultation.
Ensures greater protection for leaseholders against piecemeal charges.
Arnold v Britton
×
Year: 2015 | Court: Supreme Court

Key Findings:
A landmark case on the interpretation of service charge clauses.
Leases contained a clause increasing service charges by a fixed 10% compound interest per year.
Over time, this led to astronomical charges (thousands of pounds per year).
Supreme Court ruled that clear language in a contract must be upheld, even if the result is disastrous for one party.
Courts will not intervene to fix a "bad bargain."
Highlights the critical importance of checking lease terms before purchase.
