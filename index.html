<h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>

<div class="content-box">

<p><strong>Bergason Block Management</strong> offers a complete professional property management service for freeholders, residential management companies and property developers.</p>

<p><strong>Specialised Expertise:</strong> With over 37 years in the property and legal industry, we focus on customer service, ensuring dedicated attention to your property needs.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Contact:</strong> We operate a 24hr, 7 days a week service for emergencies. This is to ensure all issues are dealt with and hopefully abated before further issues could arise.</p>

<p><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Our clients often experience a 15–25% reduction in expenditure within the first year, leading to lower service charges.</p>

<p><strong>Personalised Service:</strong> As a family-run business, we prioritise face-to-face communication and swift responses to address concerns.</p>

<p>At Bergason we’ve listened to our clients’ needs with regards to their block management and have developed property management solutions to accommodate their specific needs — delivering tailored solutions that allow us to manage your developments in the most effective way possible.</p>

<p>We can provide a bespoke service that offers the flexibility you need — freeing you, the freeholder and/or directors, to make discretionary expenditure decisions without the mountains of paperwork you might experience elsewhere.</p>

<p>We can offer a total hands-on approach; a Director will deal with your block personally, or step back to allow the right amount of day-to-day control in your hands if required. This versatility has helped Bergason become a recommended block management company offering a comprehensive service that gives you freedom and peace of mind.</p>

<p>If you’ve been told that changing block management companies is a logistical nightmare — it’s not. We have everything in place to do this for you, with a normal transition period of just 5–7 days. You may need to get used to our rapid response times — we work when you need us, with emergency assistance available 24 hours a day and contractors ready to respond immediately where your property is at risk.</p>

<h3>Typical Block Management Tasks Include:</h3>

<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>Preparing and distributing service charge budgets/estimates.</li>
<li>Collecting service charges.</li>
<li>Preparation of invoices prior to examination by an independent accountant.</li>

</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list, but represents the minimum level of service once Bergason have been instructed.</p>

<p>Our fees range from <strong>£14–£18 + VAT per property per month</strong>, depending on services required.</p>

<p>We recommend a free site visit to understand your needs and tailor a package accordingly.</p>
